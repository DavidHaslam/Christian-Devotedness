## Edited copy
The file "CHRISTIAN DEVOTEDNESS.edit.html" was derived from the original transcript as follows:
* The edited file no longer uses HTML entities.
* It uses an actual no break space.
* It uses U+201C and U+201D for double quotation marks.
* It uses U+2019 instead of the ASCII apostrophe for the typographical apostrophe.
* It uses U+2010 hyphen instead of the Unicode replacement character.

These changes were done on 2025-04-24 using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) with [PCRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions) find and replace.
