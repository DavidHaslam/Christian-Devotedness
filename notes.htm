  <li><a name="01"></a><font size="3">The texts which seem to give another aspect to this
    question, such as, &quot;He that provident not for his own, etc.&quot;-&quot;The parents
    ought to lay up for the children, etc.&quot; - &quot;Provide things honest in the sight of
    all men,&quot; are considered together in a note at the end of the Pamphlet.</font> [see
    APPENDIX]<br>
  </li>
  <li><big><a name="02"></a></big><font size="3">[ It should be remembered that in this
    passage the words &quot;take no thought&quot; should have been rendered &quot;Be not
    anxious&quot;. See the Revised Version.]</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="03"></a><font size="3">&quot;He could not tell into whose bands his wealth
    would pass ; nor would it be any comfort to him, even for his children or friends to
    possess it, when he was torn from all which he loved and idolized, and plunged into the
    pit of destruction ; and perhaps they too were preparing by it for the same dreadful
    end&quot;- (Scott).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Though possessions are useful to sustain life, yet no man is able to prolong life,
    and to make it any thing more happy and comfortable to him, by possessing more than he
    needs or uses, that is, by any superfluity of wealth. The only way to be the better for
    the wealth of the world, is to dispose and distribute it to the service of God, and
    benefit and comfort of others&quot;-[Hammond].</font><br>
  </li>
  <li>[<a name="04"></a><font size="3"> The argument is not distinctly affected, but it is to
    be observed that the Lord did not here speak of being &quot;saved&quot;, but of entering
    the Kingdom. That the disciples at that time thought the two ideas were the same does not
    establish it, for prior to the gift of the indwelling Spirit of truth they misunderstood
    other things that the Lord said. Matt. 16. 22 : Luke 22. 36 : Acts 1. 6. For the same
    thought compare Mat. 5<i>.</i> 20 ; 18. 1­3 : 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10 ) Gal. 5. 19, 21 : Eph. 5.
    5 ; all addressed to persons already &quot;saved&quot;.]<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><a name="05"></a><font size="3">Although this Essay seems to have respect rather to
    those who have much to bestow, than those who have little, yet what the Apostle says as an
    encouragement to labour, may be applied to every man however humble.- &quot;Let him
    labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him
    that needeth&quot; (Eph. 4. 28). &quot;I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or
    apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities,
    and to them that were with me. I have showed you all things, how that so labouring ye
    ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 'It
    is more blessed to give than to receive' &quot; (Acts 20. 33­35).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="06"></a><font size="3">&quot;What shall I more say? for the time would fail me
    to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae ;- of David also, and
    Samuel, and of the Prophets : who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
    obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the
    edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
    flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again : and
    others were tortured, not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better
    resurrection : and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of
    bonds and imprisonment : they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
    slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheep­skins and goat­skins ; being
    destitute, afflicted, tormented : (of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in
    deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth&quot; (Heb. 11. 32­38).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="07"></a><font size="3">[In 1842 Mr. and Mrs. Groves adopted a child of eight as
    daughter, &quot;an orphan who was commended to their care by her father on his <i>death­bed.</i>
    This charge was a source of <i>great comfort</i> to them : they undertook it as unto the
    Lord, who truly gave them their hire. The child, being early converted to God, grew up to
    be a <i>very efficient</i> help in their mission work, when other labourers were withdrawn
    ; and she became to them, in every way, as a beloved daughter&quot; (400).</font>]<br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="08"></a><font size="3">&quot;I see here Parents who are toiling night and day.
    'What are you doing ?' 'I have a large family of children ; and I am endeavouring to lay
    up a portion for them.' 'Why then do you not in truth lay up a portion for them ! What !
    will you lay up a little dust, and call that a portion ? Is that a portion for an immortal
    soul ? You <i>are rather hanging a millstone about the necks of your</i> <i>children which
    may sink them deeper into</i> <i>ruin. You</i> <i>may thereby tempt them</i> <i>to plunge
    into the world : and there they may scatter what you have treasured up, and called</i> <i>a
    portion ! '</i>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul,' - is the declaration of David ; and
    till you lead your children to this portion, you are making no real provision for them'
    &quot; (Cecil).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="09"></a><font size="3">&quot;Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he
    laid down his life for us ; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso
    hath this world's good, and teeth his brother have need, and shutters up his bowels of
    compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him ?&quot; (1 John 3. 16, 17). And
    &quot;how dwelleth the love of God in him&quot; who can behold his fellows, by millions,
    perishing with ignorance - that hunger of the soul -, without putting forth every effort,
    and making every sacrifice, that they may receive the bread of life.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><font size="3">&nbsp;<a name="10"></a>The Christian Motto should be - Labour hard,
    consume little, give much, and all to Christ.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="11"></a><font size="3"> &quot;Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when
    the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about ? [Revised Version &quot;iniquity at my
    heels&quot;, that is, enemies who would work iniquity.] They that trust in their wealth,
    and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ; none of them can by any means
    redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him ; (for the redemption of their soul
    is precious. and it ceaseth [faileth] for ever ;) that he should still live for ever, and
    not see corruption. For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish
    person perish, and leave their wealth to others. Their inward thought is, that their
    houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling­places to all generations ; they call
    their lands after their own names. Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not : he is
    like the beasts that perish. This, their way, is their folly ; yet their posterity approve
    their sayings.- The upright shall not be ashamed in the evil time ; and in the days of
    famine they shall be satisfied. I have been young, and now am old ; yet have I not seen
    the righteous forsaken. nor his seed begging bread&quot; (Psalm 49. 5­13 ; and 37. 19 and
    25) - &quot;God hath fed me,&quot; says Scott, &quot;all my life long. I die. but God can
    provide for my children, and children's children without <i>me</i> ; I cannot without <i>Him.</i>
    I have not, since I came here, allowing for my house, cleared £100 a year : yet the Lord
    hath provided ; and I live in plenty, and can give something. and, if more money were good
    for me, he would give it.&quot; - What he farther says, in speaking of the
    &quot;carnal&quot; anxiety of Parents for the temporal welfare of their children, though
    applied by himself to the clergy in particular, is equally applicable to the laity.
    &quot;I often think what St. Paul would say to ministers in our days, on this ground ;
    when of those in his days he says,-All seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ -
    (see my note on the passage.) I have long lamented that we cannot serve God by the day,
    and leave it to ham to provide day by day for us and ours&quot; (Scott's Letters-
    London-1824 ; pages 296­7).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="12"></a><font size="3"> By wealthy, I mean those who have large incomes, as
    contrasted with those who have a bare subsistence from their labours, or those who have
    inheritances entailed upon them, so that they cannot enjoy the privilege of disencumbering
    themselves.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="13"></a><font size="3"> Now many may say, these commands are so clear that none
    could misunderstand them. but not so these under consideration ; perhaps if we were to
    analyze a little deeper our hearts, we should find that the one owes its clearness to our
    freedom from any consequent burden on finding them clear ; the other its indistinctness
    from the reverse, not having yet learnt the glorious liberty of depending on and yielding
    all to Christ. In heaven they are seen to be, I have no doubt, equally clear, equally
    commands, or rather privileges, of the saints of God.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="14"></a><font size="3"> How different the spirit and conduct of our Blessed
    Lord ! Did he fear to leave. without temporal Provision, his widowed Mother to the
    promises and providence of God ? No ; he left her unprovided to an unprovided (Acts 3.1
    and 6) disciple : and this he did, not at a time when probabilities were greatly in favour
    of a comfortable competence being easily procured, but when he knew that difficulties and
    dangers would beset them at every step. Surely had laying up <i>beforehand</i> been the
    duty of a child, our Saviour would have exhibited this virtue among that constellation of
    virtues which shone forth from his character ; for he knew that we were to follow his
    example. Why then did he act thus, whilst we hesitate to follow his steps ? Because he
    knew the truth, nature, and extent, of the promises of God, which we doubt or deny. Some
    will say <i>-</i> &quot;But this was a provision!&quot; Yes,- the very provision which God
    will ever make for those that trust in Him,- a provision at the moment of necessity.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="15"></a><font size="3"> I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and
    poor people, and <i>they</i> <i>shall</i> <i>trust</i> in the name of the Lord. They shall
    feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid&quot; (Zeph. 3. 12 and 13).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="16"></a><font size="3"> He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ;
    and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he
    purposely in his heart, so let him give ; not grudgingly, or of necessity : for God loveth
    a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye, always
    having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work : (as it is written,
    He hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor ; his righteousness remaineth for
    ever. Now he that administereth seed to the sower, both minister bread for your food, and
    multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness :) being enriched
    in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. For the
    administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant
    also by many thanksgivings unto God ; (whiles by the experiment of this ministration they
    glorify God for your professed subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal
    distribution unto them, and unto all men : ) and by their prayer for you, which long after
    you for the exceeding grace of God in you&quot; (II Cor. 9. 6­14).</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="17"></a><font size="3"> [ I cannot refrain from inviting any candid and careful
    reader to compare the rendering of this passage as given with the rendering in the Revised
    Version, as an instance of the real need there was for a revision of the English version.
    Especially is this seen from verse 10 and onward. Let him notice the words - ministereth
    and administration, experiment, professed; the change from &quot;both&quot;- expressing a
    desire, to &quot;shall&quot; - making a promise or assurance. And if he can compare the
    Greek he will notice the opening of verse 10, where the construction of the Greek was
    missed, &quot;bread for food&quot; being connected wrongly with the words following
    instead of with the words preceding, and &quot;your&quot; was inserted ; and then the last
    clause quoted (verse 14) made clear and emphatic in the Revised Version.</font>]<br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="18"></a><font size="3"> It might be an examination of not less importance, to
    ascertain why provision for future possible wants is almost the only point, in which the
    Christian and the man of the world stand on the same ground, pursue the same ends, and
    govern themselves by the same maxims ; and how it happens that this part of our duty, if
    it indeed be such, coincides so exactly with our natural propensities.</font><br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="19"></a><font size="3"> What is here meant is - that the principle, contended
    for, by no means precludes the carrying on such pursuits as require a large stock. But. as
    he, who had ten talents, used them as a servant, and brought the interest to his Master,
    so the Christian Merchant lives and labours as a servant purchased by his Lord, and
    considers his gains, as designed for his Master's service, not his private emolument. If
    he so arts, whatever his station may be, he has given up all for Christ. He remains where
    he is, not for his own private advantage, but that, as a faithful steward, he may pour
    forth the rich abundance, which God grants to his labours, to nourish and build up the
    Church, and enlarge the confines of his Master's kingdom, and the only personal advantage
    he has above his poorer brother is, he has more anxieties (but for Christ, who sweetens
    them) every step he advances up, and therefore would have no personal inducement to get up
    but the sense of duty, that he may have more abundantly to give to him who needeth. and
    the guinea dedications and speeches from the rich, would pass out together as no longer
    needed ; for one <i>action </i>of real dedication would contain more argument than a
    thousand <i>speeches</i> about it, from those who are laving in all the luxuries of life,
    and yield more help than a thousand guineas, and there would be left for the poorer, and
    the <i>poorest</i> would bring in their blessed two mites.</font></li>
